# DefCost – Workplace Defender Pricing Tool

DefCost is a browser-based estimating and quoting tool for Workplace Defender.  
It loads an Excel workbook of products/services and lets estimators build quotes structured into **Sections**, with support for **sub-items**, drag-reorder, and CSV export.

---

## Tech Stack

- Pure **HTML / CSS / Vanilla JavaScript** (single file: `index.html`)
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages**
- Libraries
  - **SheetJS** (`xlsx.full.min.js`) – Excel parsing
  - **SortableJS** – drag-and-drop ordering
- Data source: **`Defender Price List.xlsx`** (must be in repo root)
- Persistence: **localStorage** key `defcost_basket_v2`
- Locale: **AUD**, **GST 10%**
- Dark mode supported

---

## Core Features

### Quote Builder (replaces old “Quote Basket”)
- **Sections**: create, rename, delete; one **active** section at a time
- **Items**: add from catalog or custom; qty, unit price, totals
- **Sub-items**: optional nested lines that roll up into the parent and section totals
- **Reorder**: drag-and-drop for items (and keep sub-items with their parent)
- **Totals**:
  - Each section shows **Ex. GST**, **GST**, and **Total**
  - Footer shows **grand totals** (Ex. GST, GST, Total)
- **CSV export**: section-aware, includes grand totals
- **Clipboard**: click any non-input cell to copy its text
- **Sticky header**: stable sizing with `scrollbar-gutter: stable`

---

## Totals Logic

- Line Ex. GST = `qty × price`
- Line GST = `Line Ex. GST × 0.10`
- Line Total = `Line Ex. GST + Line GST`
- Section subtotals = sum of **parent items + sub-items** in that section
- Grand totals = sum of all section subtotals

## File Layout
index.html                 # All UI + logic
xlsx.full.min.js           # SheetJS (local fallback)
Defender Price List.xlsx   # Workbook loaded by the app
---

## Do Not Break

- **Workbook loading** path or filename
- **localStorage schema** and key: `defcost_basket_v2`
- **Sections** structure and item→sub-item relationships
- **Sticky header** / seam fix (don’t move padding/borders from the sticky wrapper)
- **CSV export** shape and ordering
- **Clipboard copy** behavior
- **Dark mode** toggle

---

## Current Status

- Implemented: **Sections + section totals + sub-items**
- In progress (design): **Floating “Quote Builder” window** with macOS-style controls  
  - 🔴 Delete quote (with optional CSV save)  
  - 🟡 Minimise to dock icon  
  - 🟢 Full-screen quote view

---

## Versioning

- **1.1.1** – Sections UI refinements, bug fixes
- **1.1.0** – Introduced Sections and section totals
- Planned: **1.2.0** – Floating Quote Builder window with macOS-style controls

## For Codex & AI Editors

When you make feature changes in this repo, also keep this README aligned.

1. **Update the version** in this README when you change the `<title>` and `<h1>` in `index.html`.
2. Add a concise bullet under **Versioning** describing the change.
3. Preserve the **Do Not Break** rules (don’t alter the loading path, persistence key, or sticky header structure).
4. Keep the **CSV export format** and **section/sub-item** relationships intact.
5. If you modify basket/sections/sub-items logic, confirm **grand totals** still equal the sum of all sections and that CSV export remains consistent.
